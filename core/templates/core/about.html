                <p class="mb-3">
    ByteOverflow is more than a collection of tutorials — it’s a space where design, philosophy, and purpose come together. Instead of following a generic, modern blog template, it was built from the ground up to feel distinct and personal. The visual style blends retro and futuristic influences, creating a sense of nostalgia for early computing while looking ahead with clean, modern lines. Every detail is intentional — crafted to make the experience both memorable and uniquely ByteOverflow.

                <p class="mb-3">The robots of ByteOverflow aren’t just decoration — they’re companions in the creative journey. Each one embodies curiosity, experimentation, and the persistence to keep learning. Their retrofuturistic design blends nostalgia with imagination, capturing the spirit of exploring old ideas through a modern lens. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they spark smoke, but they always keep going — just like real makers do.
